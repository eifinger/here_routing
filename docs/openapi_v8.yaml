        Decodes and returns a route from a previously calculated route handle.

        **Disclaimer: A route handle is not suitable for persistent route storage! It can be
        invalidated at any time.**

        A route handle encodes a previously calculated route. A route can be decoded from a handle
        as long as the service uses the same map data and encoding that were used when retrieving the handle.

        Thus it is suitable for caching routes compactly. It can be used to retrieve updated traffic
        information or other data along the route. However, a user should be prepared to recalculate
        the route when decoding the handle fails.

        All parameters of the `/routes` endpoint are supported, except for `destination`, `via`,
        `alternatives` and `routingMode`. See also the `return` parameter of `/routes` endpoint.

        The `origin` parameter can be provided to update the start of the previously calculated
        route.

        The `transportMode` parameter does not have to match the transport mode previously used for
        route calculation. However, when using a different transport mode, the request may fail,
        e.g. when the route has road segments forbidden for the provided transport mode.

        Please refer to the developers' guide for more information and examples.

      description: |
        Avoid routes that violate certain features of road network or that go through
        user-specified geographical bounding boxes.

        Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
        feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
        route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
        include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
        restrictions.

        It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
        waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
        requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
        `avoid[features]=ferry`.

        Further, avoid can cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too
        hard to find.

        Specify properties using array notation like `avoid[features]=controlledAccessHighway,tunnel`.

        ## Format

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=value1;option2=value2...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=value1!option2=value2...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        Supported place options:

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          This can e.g. include things like: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radius more than 200meter are
          not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
          For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
        * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
          specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
          Extension Map.
          Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
          Extension Map.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
          the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
          Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.
          Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

          **Alpha**: This API is coming soon. It may not be stable and is subject to change.

        Supported waypoint options:

        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds. The section arriving at this
          via waypoint will have a `wait` post action reflecting the stopping time. The
          consecutive section will start at the arrival time of the former section + stop
          duration.
        * `passThrough`: option is not supported for 'destination'.

        Notes:

        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.

        ## Format

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=value1;option2=value2...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=value1!option2=value2...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        Supported place options:

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          This can e.g. include things like: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radius more than 200meter are
          not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
          For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
        * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
          specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
          Extension Map.
          Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
          Extension Map.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
          the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
          Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.

          **Alpha**: This API is coming soon. It may not be stable and is subject to change.

        Notes:

        * `stopDuration` option is not supported for `origin`, contrary to `destination` and
          `via` waypoints.
        * `passThrough`: option is not supported for 'origin'.
        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.

          cases, the route returned by the `fast` mode may not be the route with the fastest
          possible travel time. For example, the routing service may favor a route that remains on
          a highway, even if a faster travel time can be achieved by taking a detour or shortcut
          through an inconvenient side road.
        * `short`: Route calculation from start to destination disregarding any speed information.
          In this mode, the distance of the route is minimized, while keeping the route sensible.

      description: |
        A location defining a via waypoint.

        A via waypoint is a location between origin and destination. The route will do a stop
        at the via waypoint.

        Multiple waypoints can also be specified using multiple via parameters like
        `via=...&via=...`, in which case the route will traverse these waypoints sequentially in
        the order specified in the request.

        ## Format

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=value1;option2=value2...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=value1!option2=value2...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        Supported place options:

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          This can e.g. include things like: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radius more than 200meter are
          not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
          For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
        * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
          specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
          Extension Map.
          Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
          Extension Map.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
          the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
          Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.
          Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

          **Alpha**: This API is coming soon. It may not be stable and is subject to change.

        Supported waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

          Following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.
          + Setting `passThrough=true` for `origin` or `destination` of a route.
          The default value is `false`.

        Notes:

        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.
          Please refer to the developers' guide for more details.

           Incidents are localized to the requested language.
           This requires `incidents` to be specified as part of the `return` parameter.
        * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
        * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
        * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
          parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
          e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, truck[height]. The full list of toll-related attributes is available in the

          cases, the route returned by the `fast` mode may not be the route with the fastest
          possible travel time. For example, the routing service may favor a route that remains on
          a highway, even if a faster travel time can be achieved by taking a detour or shortcut
          through an inconvenient side road.
        * `short`: Route calculation from start to destination disregarding any speed information.
          In this mode, the distance of the route is minimized, while keeping the route sensible.
          This includes, for example, penalizing turns. Because of that, the resulting route will
          not necessarily be the one with minimal distance.

            A reference to a routing zone in HMC.

            The standard representation of a routing zone reference has the following structure:
            `{catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{zoneId}`

            The individual parts are:
            * `catalogHrn`: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the routing zone, example: `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2`
            * `catalogVersion`: The catalog version
            * `layerId` (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the routing zone is located, example: `environmental-zones`
            * `tileId`: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the routing zone is located in the given version of the catalog
            * `zoneId`: The identifier of the referenced routing zone within the catalog, example: `here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            Example of a reference to an environmental zone in standard form:
            `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1557:environmental-zones:all:here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            In order to reduce reponse size, routing zone references can also be provided in a compact representation.
            In compact form, parts of a reference are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the `refReplacements` dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is `\$\d+` and needs to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: `(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)`

            Example of the aforementioned environmental zone reference in compact form: `$0:$1:3455277`
            With the corresponding `refReplacements`:
            ```
            "refReplacements": {
              "0": "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1557",

            no notices will be given regarding the requirement to have it.
            Additionally, the price for payment with transponders will be used when reporting fare prices
            and summaries, if required by the `tolls[summaries]` parameter.

            The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of transponder systems that the user has. Alternatively,
            the user can also specify `all` as a list element to state they have all required transponders along any potential route.

            given regarding the requirement to have it.

            The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of vignettes that the user has. Alternatively,
            the user can also specify `all` as a list element to state they have all required vignettes along any potential route.

            No toll costs information will be returned for a given road requiring a vignette if the user states
            they already have it, as no further payment is necessary. If `tolls` are requested for spans, the toll

For example, if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using that side in case the street has dividers. For example, `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north` side of the street should be preferred. This options is required, if `matchSideOfStreet` is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as well. Note the exception above when combined with `course`.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name. The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Instructs the router to consider all places within the given radius as potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radiuses wider than 200 meters are not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance. For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad. Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching. Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

        Supported waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

        Following scenarios is not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.
          + Setting `passThrough=true` for `origin` or `destination` of a route.
          The default value is `false`.

    WeightPerAxleGroup:
      description: |
        Specifies the weights of different axle groups, like single and tandem axles.

        This allows specification of axle weights in a more fine-grained way than `weightPerAxle`. This
        is relevant in countries with signs and regulations that specify different limits for different
        axle groups, like the USA and Sweden.

        Format: `AxleGroup:Weight[,AxleGroup2:Weight2]...`

        Allowed axle groups currently are:
          * `single`
          * `tandem`
          * `triple`

        Weights are specified in kilograms (kg) and are the total weight of the axle group.

        **Note:** `weightPerAxleGroup` and `weightPerAxle` are incompatible.
        **Limitations:** only valid for `transportMode=truck`.

            ```
            <CHARGE_0>,<RATE_0>,<CHARGE_1>,<RATE_1>,...,<RATE_N>,<CHARGE_N>
            ```

            where charge values are strictly increasing, non-negative floating-point values in units
            of (kWh), and rate values are positive floating point values in units of (kW).

            Charge values must cover the entire range of `[0, maxChargeAfterChargingStation`]. The
            charging curve is piecewise constant, e.g., for any charge in the range `[CHARGE_0,
            CHARGE_1)`, the value of the function is `RATE_0`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts and uses the charging curve to evaluate the most efficent range of
            charging. For example, if the rate of charging is high at lower levels of battery, but slows down significantly after charging a little, stopping
            often and charging less, but quicker, at each station might be better for the overall route.
            Because batteries lose charging speed with use, providing a charging curve for the
            exact battery would give more accurate charging time estimate than providing a
            generic curve for all batteries of one type.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so charging at a charging station does not happen strictly to the value of
            this parameter. Instead, the algorithm attempts to leave every station with
            different charge levels, and only the best possible combination of charging stations
            and target charge will form the final route.

            For example, if there is a fast but not reachable charging station on the route,
            the algorithm prefers first to charge at a slower station, but only to a level that enables it
            to reach the fast station. This way it calculates the best possible combination of driving
            and charging parts.

        minChargeAtChargingStation:
          description: |
            Minimum charge when arriving at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so visiting a charging station is planned not when the remaining charge is close
            to the value of this parameter but when it is part of the best possible charging
            plan for the given route.

            For example, it might prefer charging a still half-full battery at the fast charging station because
            there are only slower stations later on the route and the remaining charge is not
            enough to reach the destination without charging at all.

            Minimum charge when arriving at first charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            This overrides `minChargeAtChargingStation` for the first charging station. If not specified, `minChargeAtChargingStation`
            will be used for all charging stations, including the first one.

            This is usually used when the current charge is too low to reach a charging station within `minChargeAtChargingStation` limits.

          minimum: 0
        minChargeAtDestination:

            Minimum charge at the final route destination (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts while making sure that the actual value of the charge at the destination would be close to the
            value of this parameter. I.e., the resulting value is expected to be bigger
            than this parameter's value by no more than 10% of the battery capacity.

            The directed topology segment id including prefix (e.g '+here:cm:segment:').

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).

        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexidecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is \$\d+ and need to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: (^|:)\$\d+(:|$)

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:

            The directed topology segment id including prefix (e.g '+here:cm:segment:').

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).

        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexidecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            This attribute will not appear for HERE Public Transit v8 and HERE Intermodal Routing v8 requests

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is \$\d+ and need to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: (^|:)\$\d+(:|$)

            **Disclaimer: This property is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**

            The directed topology segment id including prefix (e.g '+here:cm:segment:').

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).
          type: string
        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexidecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is \$\d+ and need to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: (^|:)\$\d+(:|$)

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:
            "refReplacements": {
              "0": "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363:",

        chargingCurve:

            Function curve describing the maximum battery charging rate (in kW) at a given charge level (in kWh).

            The format of the string is a comma-separated list of numbers, as follows:

            ```
            <CHARGE_0>,<RATE_0>,<CHARGE_1>,<RATE_1>,...,<RATE_N>,<CHARGE_N>
            ```

            where charge values are strictly increasing, non-negative floating-point values in units
            of (kWh), and rate values are positive floating point values in units of (kW).

            Charge values must cover the entire range of `[0, maxChargeAfterChargingStation`]. The
            charging curve is piecewise constant, e.g., for any charge in the range `[CHARGE_0,
            CHARGE_1)`, the value of the function is `RATE_0`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts and uses the charging curve to evaluate the most efficent range of
            charging. For example, if the rate of charging is high at lower levels of battery, but slows down significantly after charging a little, stopping
            often and charging less, but quicker, at each station might be better for the overall route.
            Because batteries lose charging speed with use, providing a charging curve for the
            exact battery would give more accurate charging time estimate than providing a
            generic curve for all batteries of one type.

            Maximum charge to which the battery should be charged at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than or equal to the value of `maxCharge`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so charging at a charging station does not happen strictly to the value of
            this parameter. Instead, the algorithm attempts to leave every station with
            different charge levels, and only the best possible combination of charging stations
            and target charge will form the final route.

            For example, if there is a fast but not reachable charging station on the route,
            the algorithm prefers first to charge at a slower station, but only to a level that enables it
            to reach the fast station. This way it calculates the best possible combination of driving
            and charging parts.

            Minimum charge when arriving at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so visiting a charging station is planned not when the remaining charge is close
            to the value of this parameter but when it is part of the best possible charging
            plan for the given route.

            For example, it might prefer charging a still half-full battery at the fast charging station because
            there are only slower stations later on the route and the remaining charge is not
            enough to reach the destination without charging at all.

            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            This overrides `minChargeAtChargingStation` for the first charging station. If not specified, `minChargeAtChargingStation`
            will be used for all charging stations, including the first one.

            This is usually used when the current charge is too low to reach a charging station within `minChargeAtChargingStation` limits.

            Minimum charge at the final route destination (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts while making sure that the actual value of the charge at the destination would be close to the
            value of this parameter. I.e., the resulting value is expected to be bigger
            than this parameter's value by no more than 10% of the battery capacity.

            * `transportMode=car`
            * `routingMode=fast`

            not available in the response. The rest of the route is intact.
